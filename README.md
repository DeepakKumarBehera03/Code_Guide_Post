I am created this simple Code_Post website which allows all coders from biginning level to advance level also some blog about coding like about new era of AI, 
So any coder can post any code_blog and only the admin can update/delete the post, but if there is a another person seeing this code_post then he/she can't make any changes into this,
But yes, he/she can comment on that post , that how the post looks like and if anyone want to make any documentation of any programming language then he/she can doit.
because of this people can interacct with each other they can learn from each other.

so there is a database which is helps to store the details of the user/admin then convert the password into hashcode for security purpose. also he/she will put the wrong password/username in future
then it will show an error on screen that the username or password is wrong, also they can logout from the system by just clicking on the logout button, 

if there is a person not loged in then will show both signup and login button , But after the login successful the login and signup button will disappear then only logout button is appearing.
